# Telecom Churn Prediction

Churn is a significant challenge in the telecom industry. Research indicates that the average monthly churn rate among the top four wireless carriers in the US is 1.9% to 2%. Churn refers to customers leaving their current service provider for another, and high churn rates can have a negative impact on a telecom company's revenue and profitability.

In this project, we analyze a dataset from Kaggle, specifically the [Telecom Customer Churn dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lampubhutia/telecomcustomer-churn). This dataset provides valuable information about telecom customers and various features that might be associated with churn. Our objective is to gain insights into customer churn behavior and potentially build a predictive model to identify customers at risk of churning.

## Project Overview

Churn, in the context of the telecom industry, refers to customers leaving their current service provider for another. This project aims to understand the data related to telecom customer churn and make predictions based on the available information.

## Data Exploration

We begin by exploring the dataset. This step involves loading and examining the dataset's structure, size, and initial records to gain an understanding of the available data.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing includes tasks like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as needed. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis and model building.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization plays a crucial role in understanding the distribution of features, exploring correlations, and identifying trends related to customer churn. Visualizations help us make data-driven decisions.

## Feature Selection

To build accurate predictive models, we select relevant features that are strongly associated with churn prediction. Feature selection might involve engineering new features and reducing dimensionality.

## Model Building

In this phase, we build machine learning models, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, or other classification models, to predict customer churn. These models use historical data to identify patterns and make predictions.

## Model Evaluation

The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Model evaluation helps us assess how well our models can predict customer churn.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project aims to provide insights into telecom customer churn behavior and potentially contribute to strategies that can be implemented to reduce churn rates in the industry. The data-driven approach can assist telecom companies in improving customer retention and overall business performance.

Throughout this project, we follow best practices in data analysis, including data visualization, feature engineering, and model selection. We hope that the insights gained from this analysis will be valuable in addressing the challenge of telecom customer churn.

## How to Run

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Run the Google Colab notebook `Churn_data_analysis.ipynb`.

2. Upload the `churn_dataset.csv` file to your Google Colab environment. Make sure the file is in the same directory as the notebook.

3. In the notebook, import the dataset correctly by reading it from the uploaded file:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   churn_data = pd.read_csv('churn_dataset.csv')
